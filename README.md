# Social Media
A very basic Drupal 7 block that provides a block with social media links with an admin page to manage the links. No CSS provided with this module and that's done on purpose. Style it as needed via your theme.

# Install
Install like any other module. 
Then configure the links here: admin/content/social_media
Then go to the block configuration to place it in the region that works for you: admin/structure/block

This module contains a TPL file that you can rearrange or modify as needed.
